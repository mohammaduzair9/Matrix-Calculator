# MatrixCalculator-using-Java-OOP
This is a JAVA based Matrix Calculator, which takes as input multiple matrices from user and applies user requested operations on them.
This repo contains codes and unit test for this calculator.

# How it works
The program first asks user to enter the matrices and their names. Then user can enter an equation of any combination of following:
  *	Matrix Sum
  *	Matrix Difference
  *	Matrix Multiplication
  *	Scalar Multiplication
  *	Matrix Transpose
  *	Matrix Inverse
  
# How to run:
When the program starts, enter the matrices you want to make. Then when asked enter equation involving multiple matrices in the following format.
*	Do not use spaces between operators and matrix names
*	Start with a matrix name always
*	Use :
    * "+" for addition
    *	"â€“" for subtraction
    * "*" for multiplication
    * "~" for inverse
    * "^" for transpose
    * "*" followed by a scalar for scalar multiplication
